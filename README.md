# Qubic a quorum-based computations protocol.

In this tutorial we'll setup a Public or Non Public Qubic Node. This tutorial is a community initiative. For more information or questions join [Syzygy Discord ](https://discord.gg/2vDMR8m "Syzygy Discord").

Qubic software is running on baremetal machines without any OS installed, the software is a so called UEFI application and for security reasons we compile it ourselves with the .cpp files provided by [Come-from-Beyond](https://twitter.com/c___f___b "Twitter").
